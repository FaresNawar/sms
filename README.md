# Student Management System
SMS (student management system), in brief, is a primitive application that supports handling data in the form of classes and students, allowing you to manage a large number of pupils easily.

## About
SMS is a console application written in plain C.
It utilizes the linear [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) commonly known as "[doubly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list)" to store and manipulate a lot of data efficiently.

## Credits
SMS was written solely by **Fares Mostafa**, as a graduation project for level 3 of the "Embedded Systems Additional Course" provided by MICA and supervised under **Eng. Hassan Talal**
